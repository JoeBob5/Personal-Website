    about: `Word Frequency takes a segment of text and returns the amount of 
    time each word appears in it. The user can choose to add or remove certain 
    parts of speech (articles, linking verbs, prepositions, etc.). Additionally, 
    the user can choose the minimum time a word needs to appear in the text for 
    it to be counted in the results.`,
    purpose: `When writing, it is common to become fixated with a certain word. 
    The word might be interesting, aesthetically pleasing, or simply new. 
    If it is used too much, however, it can be annoying to the reader. 
    This program aims to fix this problem. It analyzes a user-provided 
    segment of text and returns the frequency that  each word appears in the text.`
